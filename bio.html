            <p>
                I am a Product Enthusiast and I am passionate about bringing innovative products to improve 
                the lives of others. My passion for technology drove me to quit my job and pursue 
                my major in Information Technology with minor in Product Management from Northwestern University.
            <br/>   <br/>
            Before this, I was working with Unilever industries, which is a consumer product 
            industry dealing in both B2B and B2C arenas. I worked there for 3 years as a Subject 
            Matter Expert and as a technical project manager. Throughout my tenure, I was involved 
            with different teams. I have worked with operations team to design and develop solutions 
            to reduce customer tickets and system issues. I have worked with design and development 
            team to deliver a migration project where we moved more than 500 customers from an 
            on-premise business integrator to an iPaaS cloud version. <br/><br/>
                I consider myself a quick learner and am always looking to learn different things.
                I have a creative and innovative mind with lots of ideas and a passion to convert 
                those ideas into scalable products that would help the society in a better way.
